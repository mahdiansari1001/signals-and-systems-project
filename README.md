signals and systems project :

This project explores key concepts of signal and image processing through two practical phases using MATLAB and Python.  

- Phase One:  
  Implemented several noise reduction techniques including FIR, IIR, and Adaptive (LMS) filtering to remove power line noise from audio signals.  
  Applied Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) techniques to enhance signal clarity and reduce external interference.  
  Additionally, performed LSB steganography decoding to extract hidden messages from encoded sound files.  

- Phase Two:  
  Designed a simplified License Plate Recognition (LPR) system using correlation-based character matching.  
  Applied image segmentation, deblurring filters, and sampling analysis to recognize characters under both ideal and blurred imaging conditions.  

The project utilizes libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy for processing, visualization, and analysis.
